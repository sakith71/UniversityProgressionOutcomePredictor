# University Progression Outcome Predictor

## Overview

The University Progression Outcome Predictor is a Python-based application designed to evaluate the progression status of university students at the end of each academic year. Analyzing student credit data determines whether a student can progress to the next academic year, must repeat certain modules, or faces exclusion based on their academic performance.

## Description

This application helps university administrators efficiently process student results using a structured method of input and calculation. It categorizes student outcomes into four primary statuses:

- **Progress**: The student advances to the next academic year.
- **Progress (module trailer)**: The student progresses but needs to retake specific modules.
- **Do not Progress â€“ module retriever**: The student must repeat some modules before advancing.
- **Exclude**: The student is excluded due to poor academic performance.

## Key Features

1. **Interactive User Input**: The program provides a user-friendly interface for entering student credit data, ensuring inputs are valid and total credits sum to 120.

2. **Multiple Student Processing**: Users can input data for multiple students in one session, facilitating efficient handling of large datasets.

3. **Data Validation**: Ensures accuracy by validating all inputs and providing feedback and error messages for corrections.

4. **Graphical Representation**: Generates a histogram using the "graphics.py" module, offering a visual summary of student outcomes for easy interpretation.

5. **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Maintains records in a list and exports results to a text file for documentation and further analysis.

## Project Structure

Here's how the project is organized:
- **UniversityProgressionOutcomePredictor.py**: The main script containing the logic for processing student progression outcomes.
- **graphics.py**: A module responsible for generating visual representations, such as histograms, to display progression results.

## How to Run

**Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakith71/UniversityProgressionOutcomePredictor.git
